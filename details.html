	<h3>I haven't got any results, how can I make a poster?</h3>
		<p>This is the best time to do a poster because you can give an accessible overview of what you research is going to be about and get feedback, advice and ideas from staff and postgrads whom you wouldn't normally meet. People from other research areas will have a different, useful perspectives on your research plan or problems.</p>
	<h3>I think my research might be too [something] for 'natural systems and processes'</h3>
		<p>With research groups from across the natural sciences, there is a good chance that someone outside of your department will be interested in your topic. We invite social science as well as science students to submit posters and would like to encourage interdisciplinary conversations.</p>
	<h3>What should my poster be about?</h3>
		<p>The poster focus can be as broad as the general background to your research and what you plan to do, the pioneering methodology you're using, or narrowing down on some specific results.</p>
	<h3>Can I use an old poster?</h3>		
		<p>You can re-use a poster from a poster session elsewhere if you would like to (not from NSPPS last year though!)</p>
	<h3>What should I do with my poster? / Where should I take my poster?</h3>	
		<p>Please come to Wills Memorial Great Hall on the 16th of April and put up your poster on one of the poster boards between 1 and 2 pm. If you have any questions or cannot make it please let us know (naturalsystemsandprocesses@gmail.com).</p>
		
	<h3>When are the deadlines?</h3>
		<p>Registration deadline: extended to 12th April<p>
		<p>Submit finished poster: 2 pm on the day of the poster session.<p>
		<p>You should aim to finish and send it to printer by asap to allow enough time for printing.<p>
	<h3>Who pays for printing the poster?</h3>
		<p>The responsibility of printing the poster is with the student. If you have a grant, then you should be able to use the grant charge code at the University Printing Services. The cost is relatively small (around £10 - £15 depending on size).<p>
	<h3>Can I submit more than one poster?</h3>		
		<p>Yes, if you have two or more research topics, feel free to submit more than one poster.</p>
