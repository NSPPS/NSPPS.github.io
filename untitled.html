You are invited to submit a poster to the 3rd Annual Natural Systems and Processes Poster Session.  Any Research Postgraduate studying natural systems can submit a poster.

Feel free to recycle a poster from another conference (so long as it wasn't at last year's NSPPS!) or use this as a opportunity to produce a new poster.

If you are making a new poster for this session we recommend A0 Landscape size.
Please could you deliver your printed poster to your department rep by Friday 16th March. Alternatively contact us (nspps2012@gmail.com) and we will arrange to pick it up.
The only requirement is that you stand by your poster for a 30 minute period during the 3 hour event.

Look forward to seeing you there!
