<b>Natural Systems and Processes Poster Session 2011</b><br>
Where: Wills Reception Room<br>
When: Monday 21st March 2011<br><br>
<b>2011 Poster Session Registration is now closed </b></center><br><br>

Following and expanding on Geo Poster Session 2010, all Bristol University postgraduates studying natural systems and processes are invited to an afternoon poster session aimed at increasing inter-departmental connections and exchanging new ideas across our interlinked disciplines.<br><br>

PhD and Masters Students - This is your invitation to present a poster at NSPPS showcasing your research, and to find out about current developments in Geosciences from across the University. With research groups from across the natural sciences there is a good chance that someone will be working in your area. So if you think your research is too subject-specific to be of interest to researchers in other departments, think again!<br><br>

For new PhD students, this is also the perfect opportunity to start developing essential poster-making skills, to learn how to present your research in a relaxed environment, and to find out what to expect from a poster session. The focus can be as broad as the general background to your research and what you plan to do, the pioneering methodology you're using, or narrowing down on some specific results. More experienced PhD students are more than welcome to recycle an existing poster, or to make one especially for the occasion.

Staff and post-docs are warmly invited to attend on the day and browse the array of posters on show.
