<h3>NSPPS Skills Training - Poster Presentation Workshops</h3>

<p>Date and Time : 18th March.  
	First session - 1.30 - 3PM.  Second session - 3.30 - 5PM.</p>
<p>Location : Careers Service, Training Room 4</p>

<p>For many, the poster session can feel a little like speed networking or, perhaps worse, speed dating where you are one out of hundreds hoping to find one in a million. You’ve carefully prepared your poster, your pitch and answers to as many difficult questions as you can think of. You’ve taken care of everything except that fact that you have no idea who is going to talk to you and what will interest them. If we are going to thrive in such an environment, to some extent we will need to trade comfort for potential and accept this ambiguity. This suggests that although the purpose of a poster session is the communication of research, its success depends very much on the way it is carried out.</p>

<p>This session pays no attention to the design and logistical elements of posters and printing, but asks participants to reflect on and consider their poster from the perspective of an intelligent lay audience. Using elements from Potential Energy, creative ideas from 3MT competitions and an exploration of effective professional relationships, this session challenges participants to identify the framework through which they will be better able to engage a poster session audience and make a more memorable impact.</p>

<p>Please email gemma.coxon@bristol.ac.uk to reserve your place.  Please include in the email your name, department, which session you would like to attend and the title of your NSPPS poster.  ALL students must have <a href="http://seis.bris.ac.uk/~tb7779/nspps/form.html">submitted a NSPPS poster</a> before signing up for the training session.</p>

<p>Book Now - places will be allocated on a first come, first served, basis.</p>
